      "* The problem asks to find the sum of all possible values of $n$ that satisfy a given equation.\n",
      "* The equation involves modular arithmetic: $(2n + 3) \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$.\n",
      "* The solution outline mentions the properties of modular addition and multiplication, as well as simplifying equations.\n",
      "* Three examples are provided to illustrate the process. \n",
      "## Step 1\n",
      "First, let's analyze the given equation and understand its meaning. We have $(2n + 3) \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$. This means that when we divide $2n + 3$ by 7, the remainder is 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2\n",
      "To solve for $n$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. The first step is to subtract 3 from both sides of the congruence: $(2n) \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3\n",
      "Next, since $\\gcd(2,7)=1$, which means that 2 and 7 are relatively prime, we can divide both sides by 2. However, when dividing by 2 in modular arithmetic, we must also multiply the modulus (in this case, 7) by the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 7. The multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 7 is 4 because $2 \\times 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. So, multiplying both sides by 4 gives us: $(n) \\equiv 8 \\pmod{7}$.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4\n",
      "Since $\\equiv$ in modular arithmetic implies equivalence in the set of integers modulo a number (in this case, 7), we can simplify 8 modulo 7 to get $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. This means that any integer $n = 1 + 7k$, where $k$ is an integer, will satisfy the original equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 5\n",
      "Now, we need to find all possible values of $n$ in the range $0 \\leq n < 28$. Since $n = 1 + 7k$, substituting different integer values for $k$ gives us a set of solutions: when $k=0$, $n=1$; when $k=1$, $n=8$; and so on, until we reach $k=3$, which yields $n=22$. These are the possible values of $n$ that satisfy the equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 6\n",
      "Finally, sum all these possible $n$ values: $1+8+15+22 = 46$.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final answer is: $\\boxed{46}$\n",
      "The document is a table with 3 columns and 5 rows, but the image is too blurry to read the text. The first column has 8 entries, the second column has 7 entries, and the third column has 6 entries.\n",

      "* A 3x3 grid of numbers, with some digits missing.\n",
      "* The partially visible numbers are: \"1\", \"2\", \"4\", \"5\", and \"8\".\n",
      "* Each row or column has a specific digit that appears twice (e.g., the first row has an \"8\" and another digit is \"2\").\n",
      "* The task is to find the value of the missing number in the grid. \n",
      "## Step 1\n",
      "Let's analyze the given numbers: 4, 5, 2, 8. We notice that there are two columns with a total sum of 9 (if we assume the missing number is not zero). This could be helpful for deducing which number fits into each column.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2\n",
      "Since there are two columns adding up to 9, one must have an odd sum and the other must have an even sum. We can try filling in some numbers to see if it works out: Column 1 has a \"4\", Column 3 has a \"5\" (not considering the missing number), and Column 4 has a \"2\". The remaining column, Column 3, needs a number that, when added with \"5\", will sum up to an even or odd total depending on whether it is in Column 1 or Column 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3\n",
      "Let's assume the missing number (the one not shown) is placed in Column 2. If this is correct, then Column 3 must have a number such that its column adds up to either an even sum if in Column 1 or an odd sum if in Column 4. The numbers are already starting with \"5\" in Column 3 and \"8\" in Column 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4\n",
      "For the sum of Column 3 (where we have a \"5\") to be an even number, since it's in Column 1 which needs an odd sum for balance, its partner must be an odd number. The only odd number remaining that can fit is \"1\". However, if placed here, it will not add up correctly with the missing number and \"8\" (which would total more than 9). Therefore, let's try placing our assumed missing number (\"1\") in Column 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 5\n",
      "Now looking at Column 2 where we assumed our missing number is \"1\", since Column 4 already has an even sum without needing to balance out the column sums, our assumption might be incorrect because adding \"1\" here does not fit well with the sum of 9 in any other combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 6\n",
      "Let's reconsider and try placing \"1\" as it fits perfectly if placed in either Column 2 or Column 4 since these are odd numbers. However, we made an error in our previous assumption about its placement affecting the balance needed for an even total sum without considering all possible arrangements correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 7\n",
      "Correcting our approach: We need to find a number that complements \"8\" (an even number) such that when added together with another two numbers, one of them being \"5\", it results in either an odd or even total sum. Considering the mistake made about column balance and recognizing our error in calculation steps, we should recognize now that placing \"1\" as the missing number actually works out fine because it fits perfectly within the constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 8\n",
      "Given this corrected understanding, let's deduce again: If \"1\" is placed in Column 3 (where we initially thought it might not work), but recognizing its proper placement does fit with the rest of the arrangement given. Therefore, by placing \"1\" in Column 2 and considering \"5\" as the number for Column 3 (as initially assumed correctly now), and having \"8\" in Column 4 (matching up to make even total sums where needed), it seems our original assessment was flawed due to misinterpretation of column balances.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 9\n",
      "Correcting this misunderstanding, we realize that indeed a simple arrangement with \"1\", \"5\", and \"2\" or another odd number could perfectly balance out the columns without needing an additional complex step to solve for missing numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 10\n",
      "Considering all these steps and reflections on how numbers are distributed across columns, it seems there was confusion in identifying where the missing number fits best. The correct approach would actually be simpler: Identify which numbers have already been given, their placements, and determine how they balance out without causing an imbalance that needs complex calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 11\n",
      "Given this setup, with \"4\" in Column 1, \"5\" in Column 3 (as initially thought but now recognized as a viable option), and considering the need for even and odd sums across columns to balance, recognizing that \"2\" has been placed in another column but not stated which, we identify that our missing number fits perfectly into one of these positions without causing imbalance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 12\n",
      "Upon this reflection, it becomes clear that a simpler approach was overlooked due to overcomplication. The key insight is realizing the mistake in assuming complex calculations were necessary for balance when in fact, with \"1\" in Column 2 and understanding its impact, we can see that no advanced reasoning beyond simple pattern recognition is required.\n",
